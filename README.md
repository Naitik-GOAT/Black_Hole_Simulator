# 🌌 Black Hole Physics Simulator

An interactive, physics-based space simulation that visualizes how matter, light, and time behave near a black hole. This project combines real gravitational equations with cinematic visual effects to create both an educational tool and an immersive scientific sandbox.

## 🚀 Features
### ⚫ Realistic Black Hole Physics

Gravitational attraction using Newton’s Law of Gravitation

Adjustable black hole mass

Accurate Schwarzschild Radius (Event Horizon) detection

Stable, decaying, and escape orbits

### 🌀 Accretion Disk Simulation

Orbiting particle system around the black hole

Speed increases closer to the center

Color shifts based on temperature (red → yellow → white → blue)

### 🧵 Spaghettification (Tidal Forces)

Objects stretch as they approach the black hole

Tidal force approximation based on distance

Objects can break apart before crossing the event horizon

### 💡 Gravitational Lensing

Light paths bend near the black hole

Background stars visually distort

Simulated photon ring for realism

### ⏳ Time Dilation Effects

Objects near the black hole move in slow motion

Visual representation of gravitational time dilation

## 🎮 Interactivity
